[Roboeletic](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric) example in kotlin.
Running tests on an Android emulator or device is slow! Building, deploying, and launching the app often takes a minute or more. Thatâ€™s no way to do TDD. There must be a better way.

[Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) is a unit test framework that de-fangs the Android SDK jar so you can test-drive the development of your Android app. Tests run inside the JVM on your workstation in seconds.
